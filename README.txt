 README

 Known issues: On some iterations for some reason (unknown to me, have tried to figure it out... 

 MY p0.update file, the first page (the first 16 numbers) print as 0 and not the value they should be. 

 Every other number in every other file works though. 

Also when reading files in text editors with line numbers. Remember that any line number is really one less as my address start from 0 and not 1. 


 Other than that no problems! 


 Thanks!

 Nic
